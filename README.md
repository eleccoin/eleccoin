What is Eleccoin?
----------------

Eleccoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Eleccoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Eleccoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the Eleccoin Core software, see https://eleccoin.org/en/download/, or read the
[original whitepaper].

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.
